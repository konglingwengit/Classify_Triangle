Deliverable 3: Describe your experience with this assignment, specifically:
•	What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any?
 Building logic for right angled triganle was complex as compare to other triangle types
        elif a ** 2 + b ** 2 == c ** 2:
            return "Right"

•	What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
I think about that I have to make logic for each type of triangle & then remaning possiblities are invalid triangle

•	What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
pushing files to github was little complicated using CLI.

•	Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
After Testing Program with MUltiple input test & checking if in any combination a+b > c then it's not a valid triangle
we are considering all types of triangle.
